1. What would be the best data structure to model the behavior of the supply basket?
Justify your answer and explain how it would be used.

A: I believe that the best data structure to be used for the supply basked is a queue,
since it requires to follow a order that resembles the first-in first-out pattern were
each item picked has to be consumed before the next item can be selected/used.

2. What is the time complexity of adding new seeds to the supply basket?

A: This operation should not be complex, it's consider O(1), because it adds to the end of the list.

3. What is the time complexity of removing seeds from the supply basket?

A: This operation should not be complex, it's consider O(1), because it remove an item from the front of the list.

4. What is the time complexity of checking to see if the supply basket is empty?

A: This operation should not be complex, it's consider O(1), because it checks the count or size of the list
