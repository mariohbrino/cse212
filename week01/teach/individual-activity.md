1. Do the actual results agree with the big O predictions made earlier?
If not, what do you think the big O should be?
A: Yes, the results were partually correct. I mistake the last algorithm.
I got carried by the fact it only have a while loop and did not take in
consideration the calculation could reduce the time. However, I learned
the differences and I'm more curious about it.

Algorithm1(n); // Big O = O(n) => correct
Algorithm2(n); // Big O = O(n^2) => correct
Algorithm3(n); // Big O = O(n) => wrong, the correct is O(log n)]

2. Which method (Algorithm1, Algorithm2, Algorithm3) has the best performance
and which one the worst performance?
A: The best algorithm was number 3 and the worst was number 2, this is possible
to say because of the time performed.

3. Looking at the results, why do we say that big O only applies when n in
"large"?
A: I think the big O notation is relevant when a large list takes place, but
I guess it does not limit for all cases because it depends on the algorithm
used to perform.
