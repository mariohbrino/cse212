# W01 Analyze: Performance

## Part 1: Analyze Code

- SortArray: this function should perform with a linear growing
Big O = O(n^2)

- StandardDeviation1: this function should perform with a linear growing
Big O => O(n)

- StandardDeviation2: this function should perform with a linear growing
Big O => O(n^2)

- StandardDeviation3: this function should perform with a linear growing
Big O => O(n)

## Part 2: Predicting, Measuring, and Comparing - Two Sorting Algorithms

1. Predicting

- SearchSorted1: this function should perform with a linear growing
Big O = O(n)

- SearchSorted2: this function should perform with a logarithmic growing
Big O = O(log n)

2. Measuring

It was explained that the sort count should be the same indenpendent of
the computer it runs with, on the other hand the sort tim speed can change
depending on the hardware. It's important to point out that the time can
vary on each execution, however it looks constant.

3. Comparing

A. What is the performance using big O notation for each function
(based on both your predictions and the actual results)?

Response: I noticed that both functions have close results with low time
processing, however the SearchSorted2 function has a better performance
and presents constant time with little variation.

B. Which function has the better performance in the worst case?

Response: The SearchSorted2 has a better peformance, it actually keeps a
constant time performance even on the worst case.
